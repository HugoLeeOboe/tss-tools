# TSS-Tools

Hugo Lee's tools for creating motion graphics with sheet music

[Clicker](https://hugoleeoboe.github.io/tss-tools/clicker/clicker.html) - Click to get y-values of a jpg

TODO:

Clicker2 - Same as Clicker but keeps two separate lists (for duet parts)

hl-extract-audio - Very stupid .bat script to quickly strip out mp3 audio from a video file.
